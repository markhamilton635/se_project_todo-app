# Todo Tracker

Here is a simplistic task tracking app. When you need to do something but have to much going on to keep track of it yourself, welcome to the Todo Tracker.

## Functionality

this app allows you to create a list of todos, each with their unique name. Allowing you to check whether or not you have finsihed them or not, as well as a reminder of when they are due. if there is no specicic due date feel free to leave it out. if youve finsihed the task and want to remove it or simply gave up, thats ok, there is a delete button so we can forget that task together.
